## Enhanced Wind Visualization

I've completely redesigned the wind visualization to make it much more realistic and dynamic. Here are the key improvements:

### 1. Curved Wind Streaks Instead of Square Particles

- Replaced the square particles with curved lines that follow Bezier curves
- This creates a much more natural flow that resembles real wind patterns


### 2. Dynamic Adaptation to Wind Speed

- The visualization now adapts to the wind speed in several ways:

- Faster movement for stronger winds
- Thicker lines for stronger winds
- Higher opacity for stronger winds
- More visible turbulence in stronger winds





### 3. Wind Direction Integration

- The streaks now follow the actual wind direction
- The animation moves in the direction specified by the wind direction angle
- Subtle rotation effects make the movement more natural


### 4. Color Adaptation Based on Wind Quality

- Colors change based on wind quality for kiteboarding:

- Gray for too light winds
- Blue for light winds
- Green for good winds
- Yellow for strong winds
- Red for very strong winds





### 5. Natural Movement Patterns

- Added oscillation and variation to create more natural movement
- Each streak has slightly different speed and behavior
- Streaks reset position when they move out of the visible area


### 6. Responsive Design

- The visualization adapts to the container size
- Particle density adjusts based on screen width
- Works well in both light and dark modes


### 7. Performance Optimizations

- Used Three.js efficiently to maintain good performance
- Proper cleanup of resources when component unmounts
- Optimized animation loop


### 8. Integration with UI

- Added a clean card interface with wind information overlay
- Shows wind speed and direction in an easy-to-read format
- Displays wind quality badge that matches the visualization color


This new visualization provides a much more immersive and informative experience that helps users understand wind conditions at a glance. The natural flow and dynamic adaptation to wind characteristics make it both beautiful and functional.
